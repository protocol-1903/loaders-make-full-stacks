Supports [Infinite Belt Stacking](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/infinite-belt-stacking)

Highly recommendede to be used alongside [Stacking Loaders](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/stacking-loaders) and [Lane Filtered Loaders](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/lane-filtered-loaders)

This mod makes all loaders drop full stacks only, instead of allowing partial ones. This mod does not add any loaders for the players to use, a mod like [AAI Loaders](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-loaders) must be used to add them. This process is automatic, meaning it should be compatible with mods, but also means it has the chance to break. Let me know if any issues crop up, or if you have any features you wish to be added.

If you have a mod idea, let me know and I can look into it.
